                        </header>

                        <p>These Orlando shelters support many dogs who are essentially like children; they require great care and many resources. Without your support, they cannot properly care for everyone. The dogs will become sick if they do not get enough food or they might become depressed if they have no warm bed or soft towel to dry off with. Please donate to change these precious doggos lives, they need your help today to be happy and healthy.</p>

                            <h2>Donate Supplies</h2>
                            <p>With your donation, the shelters can fund the supplies needed for the shelter to stay maintained and operational. Your financial support will help shelter staff purchase food and other items like toys and treats to keep the dogs entertained and emotionally stable. Shelters can not afford to care for all the dogs in need alone, so your help and donations keep them going when they run out of budget resources and need to feed the dogs.</p>

                            <p>The money that is donated to our organization goes to helping the dogs in shelters. Whether it is to provide them with food, water, toys or health care while in the shelter or connecting them with a loving family. All the money you donate will be put back into the shelters that we support.</p>
